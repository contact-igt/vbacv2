        q: "When should I have my first pregnancy or antenatal appointment?",
        a: "You can contact an obstetrician once you know you are pregnant. Your first antenatal visit helps confirm and understand your pregnancy, review your medical history, discuss any symptoms or concerns, and plan the scans and tests you may need. Starting antenatal care early also gives you time to understand nutrition, activity, medications and what to expect during the different stages of pregnancy.",
      },

        q: "How does preconception fertility care transition into early pregnancy care at Birthwave?",
        a: "If you conceive during preconception or PCOS care, your health history, medical records, and care plan seamlessly transition into early antenatal care with the same doctor.",

      {
        q: "What preconception health and weight checks are recommended before getting pregnant?",

      },
      {
        q: "What is antenatal care and why is it important during pregnancy?",
        a: "Antenatal care is the regular medical care and support you receive during pregnancy before your baby is born. It includes check-ups to monitor your health and your baby’s growth, along with appropriate scans, tests and screenings. It is also an opportunity to discuss nutrition, physical activity, pregnancy changes, warning signs, emotional wellbeing and preparation for birth. Regular antenatal care helps your doctor follow how your pregnancy is progressing and identify concerns that may need additional attention.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the difference between normal delivery and natural birth?",
        a: "Both usually involve giving birth vaginally, but the approach to labour and pain management may be different. Normal delivery generally means vaginal birth and may include medical support or pain-relief options such as an epidural when needed or chosen. Natural birth generally aims to allow labour and vaginal birth to progress with minimal medical intervention and without routine pain-relief medicines where possible and clinically appropriate. Support may include breathing techniques, movement, comfortable positions, relaxation and continuous physical and emotional support. The right approach depends on the mother, baby and how labour progresses, and safety always comes first.",
      },
      {
        q: "When should I start preparing for a normal delivery or natural birth?",
        a: "Birth preparation can begin during pregnancy rather than waiting until labour or the final few weeks. As your pregnancy progresses, preparation can include understanding labour, discussing your birth preferences, staying appropriately active, pregnancy-safe movement or yoga, breathing and relaxation techniques, childbirth education, nutrition and preparing mentally and physically for birth. Preparation can help you feel more informed and confident, but no particular type of delivery can be guaranteed.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I have a normal delivery after a previous C-section?",
        a: "For some women, a vaginal birth after a previous C-section may be possible. This is known as VBAC — Vaginal Birth After Caesarean. Whether VBAC is appropriate depends on factors such as the reason for your previous C-section, the type of uterine incision, your previous birth history, your current pregnancy and the health of you and your baby. If you are considering VBAC, your obstetrician can review your individual history and discuss the potential benefits, risks and other birth options with you.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does Birthwave provide nutrition, yoga and birth preparation along with antenatal care?",
        a: "Yes. Birthwave’s pregnancy care goes beyond routine antenatal consultations by bringing together medical care with supportive services for pregnancy and birth preparation. Depending on your individual needs, your care may include nutrition guidance, pregnancy yoga and movement, childbirth education, birth preparation, pelvic health support and lactation guidance, alongside your regular antenatal care. This allows different aspects of your pregnancy journey to remain connected rather than being treated separately.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does holistic pregnancy care mean?",
        a: "Holistic pregnancy care means caring for you as a whole person during pregnancy—not only monitoring your baby’s growth or completing routine tests. Alongside medical antenatal care, it considers areas such as nutrition, movement, emotional wellbeing, childbirth preparation, pelvic health and breastfeeding preparation. At Birthwave, the aim is to connect these different aspects of care so that you are supported through pregnancy, preparation for birth and the transition into postpartum recovery and newborn care.",
